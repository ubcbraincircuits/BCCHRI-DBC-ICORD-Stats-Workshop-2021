Things I wish to include: 
An explanation of the basic layout. 
An explanation of the basic commands (things like how to run a line of code)
An explanation of the R markdown format
An explanation of how to set a variable. 
An explanation of using base functions
An example of loading a package and using a package function. 
An example of how to use the help() function. 
An example For loop. 
An example plot. (show off severeal of the most basic plots and then show how you can use the 
par function to make subplots. )
A VERY basic example of working with dataframes (stuff like what does dataframe$column_name do.)
A final not on the fact that there is often more than 1 way to do things in R.
